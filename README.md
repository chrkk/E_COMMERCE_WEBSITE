# SHS Final Project Website (ACLC College of Mandaue)

This is a static website I created during my Senior High School days at ACLC College of Mandaue, under the ICT Programming Strand. It was our final project for the semester, presented to a panel as part of our course requirements.

Site live @ https://chrkk.github.io/E_COMMERCE_WEBSITE/

The site was originally based on a tutorial video I followed (which I’ve since forgotten), and while it’s not perfect, it represents my early hands-on experience with web development.

## 📁 What’s Inside
- Basic HTML structure
- CSS styling for layout and design
- JavaScript-powered login system (local storage only)
- Simple page navigation
- No backend or database integration

## 🔐 Login System
- Users must **sign up** to access the homepage.
- The signup form stores credentials locally using JavaScript and `localStorage`.
- ⚠️ **Do not use real personal information** — this is a demo site with no backend or encryption.
- Once signed up, you can explore the full site including product pages and other sections.

### 🧑‍💼 Admin Access
You can log in via the login page using:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`

This will redirect you to a dashboard page that displays:
- Daily views
- Sales
- Comments
- Earnings
- Recent orders
- Product listings
- Customer info

⚠️ All dashboard data is **UI-only** and **non-functional** — it's just for layout demonstration.

## 📝 Notes
- This project was created purely for academic purposes.
- It’s not optimized or production-ready, but it reflects my early learning.
- I may revisit it in the future to rebuild it with proper backend support and cleaner code.
- 📸 **Image Credits**: Some product photos used in this website are not owned by me. All rights belong to their respective owners. These images are used for educational and non-commercial purposes only.
- 📱 **Mobile Support**: This website is **not optimized for mobile devices**. Layout and design may break or appear distorted on smaller screens.
