# SHS Final Project Website (ACLC College of Mandaue)

This is a static website I created during my Senior High School days at ACLC College of Mandaue, under the ICT Programming Strand. It was our final project for the semester, presented to a panel as part of our course requirements.

Site live @ https://chrkk.github.io/E_COMMERCE_WEBSITE/

The site was originally based on a tutorial video I followed (which I’ve since forgotten), and while it’s not perfect, it represents my early hands-on experience with web development.

## 📁 What’s Inside
- Basic HTML structure
- CSS styling for layout and design
- JavaScript-powered login system (local storage only)
- Simple page navigation
- No backend or database integration

## 🔐 Login System
- Users can "register" and "log in" using a form.
- Credentials are stored locally in the browser using JavaScript and `localStorage`.
- This was mainly for demonstration purposes—no real security or server-side logic.

## 📝 Notes
- This project was created purely for academic purposes.
- It’s not optimized or production-ready, but it reflects my early learning.
- I may revisit it in the future to rebuild it with proper backend support and cleaner code.
